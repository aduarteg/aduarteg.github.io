I recently completed my PhD in the
[Department of Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://cmor.rice.edu/) (CMOR)
(formerly Computational and Applied Mathematics (CAAM)) at 
[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in Houston, TX, 
and will soon be joining [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) as the
[S. Scott Collis Fellow in Data Science](https://www.sandia.gov/careers/career-possibilities/students-and-postdocs/fellowships/data-science-fellowship/). 
My PhD research was advised by Prof. [Matthias Heinkenschloss](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~heinken/)
and focused on integrating neural network-based reduced-order models with domain decomposition. 
While a graduate student, I was a [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellow](https://ndseg.org/)
sponsored by the [Air Force Office of Scientific Research](https://www.afrl.af.mil/AFOSR/). 
I also maintain a collaboration with [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://www.llnl.gov/). 
Here is my [CV](ad_cv.pdf).
