## Bio
I am a computational scientist that specializes in the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to solve multi-physics problems. I recently completed my PhD in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin. I have experience in the use, development, and validation of open-source codes in fluid dynamics, and I also possess a strong background in the analysis and curation of large datasets. I am especially interested in the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and its application towards engineering systems.
