## Bio
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Department of Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research](https://cmor.rice.edu/) (CMOR)
(formerly Computational and Applied Mathematics (CAAM)) at 
[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in Houston, TX. My 
advisor is Prof. [Matthias Heinkenschloss](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~heinken/)
and my research focuses on integrating reduced order models with domain decomposition. 
I am a [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellow](https://ndseg.org/)
sponsored by the [Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)](https://www.afrl.af.mil/). 
I also maintain a collaboration with [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://www.llnl.gov/). 
Here is my [CV](ad_cv.pdf).
